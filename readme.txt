solving a leetcode problem: 24 game. 
https://leetcode.com/problems/24-game/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-08-21 

I coded my own solution for this leetcode hard, in my_solution.cpp.
While I did not specifically try to optimise for runtime or memory when i was coding, they turned out pretty good.

I also wondered if claude/ chatgpt could solve this leetcode hard, so i put them to the test.

I first asked claude to solve it in python but it did not get the full solution even after repeated prompting.
the c++ results passed the test for both LLMs, and i have attached the code snippets in separate files. 

although they were much much faster than me, i still hold my own solution dear to my heart.
